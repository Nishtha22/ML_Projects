# ML_Projects
Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository!  
This repo is a collection of hands-on ML projects I’ve worked on — ranging from classical algorithms to deep learning and API integrations.  
Each project demonstrates a unique aspect of the machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building, evaluation, and deployment.
